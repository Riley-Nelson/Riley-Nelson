# About Riley Nelson

I am intrigued by the use of software as a means to solve problems, along with the supporting design and analysis processes that lead to successful outcomes. I am fascinated by game design, as games often push technical boundaries and are finely-tuned user experiences- I want to create interactive experiences that engage people. Iâ€™ve made several toy games in Python, Javascript and Unreal Engine, and have gained experience in Autodesk Maya and proficiency in Blender. I an avid fan of Dungeons and Dragons, which requires creativity and communication skills to drive the best experiences.

I excel at problem-solving, understanding and applying complex rulesets, and finding loopholes or exploits in systems. I am energetic and diligent, with a unique and practical view of the world, allowing me to excel in many pursuits. Microsoft is an industry leader in software- from Enterprise to gaming- and I would be grateful for the opportunity to learn from the wide variety of experts who work there, as well as exposure to industry best practices.
